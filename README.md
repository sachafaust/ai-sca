# AI-Powered SCA Vulnerability Scanner

A small side project to explore how AI models can be applied to a problem space I know well—software composition analysis. The goal is to experiment with using AI for bulk scanning and potential resolution of vulnerabilities in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript dependencies, rather than following the traditional sequential API-driven approach. This isn't intended to be the fastest or most complete solution—just a way for me to learn by building, test some ideas, and hopefully spark discussion. Feedback, suggestions, and "what if you tried…" thoughts from the community are welcome.

## 🚀 Key Innovation

**Traditional SCA scanners**: Sequential API calls to vulnerability databases (1 package = 1 API call)  
**This scanner**: By leveraging modern AI models with large context windows (128K+ tokens), we can analyze a very large number of dependencies in a single request. For Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript—where individual dependency manifests are relatively small—this often means processing hundreds, or even thousands of packages at once, depending on the model used. This shifts vulnerability scanning from a sequential, API-bound process into a highly parallelized workflow, dramatically reducing the overhead of scanning at scale.

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-language support**: Python (pip, poetry, pipenv) and JavaScript (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- **AI-powered analysis**: Integrates with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI models
- **Bulk processing**: Analyze 75+ packages in a single API call
- **Location-aware recommendations**: Context-specific upgrade suggestions based on file patterns
- **Comprehensive telemetry**: Cost tracking, performance metrics, and usage analytics
- **Multiple output formats**: JSON for automation, Markdown for human review

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install from source
cd implementation
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or install package only
pip install -e .
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Scan
```bash
# Scan current directory
sca-scanner scan

# Scan specific project
sca-scanner scan /path/to/project

# Specify output format
sca-scanner scan --output-format markdown --output report.md
```

### Configuration
```bash
# Set AI provider (openai, anthropic, google)
export AI_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key

# Or use config file
sca-scanner scan --config config.yml
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Use specific AI model
sca-scanner scan --model gpt-4o-mini

# Enable telemetry
sca-scanner scan --telemetry

# Set security strategy
sca-scanner scan --strategy aggressive_security

# Custom batch size for token optimization
sca-scanner scan --batch-size 50
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### AI-First Design
- **Context Window Optimization**: Maximizes package analysis per API call
- **Intelligent Batching**: Dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on token limits
- **Pure AI Analysis**: No dependency on traditional vulnerability databases
- **Token-Efficient Prompts**: Optimized for minimal token usage while maintaining accuracy

## 📊 Validation & Testing

- **Test Coverage**: 336 passing tests across unit and integration suites
- **Python Parser**: 100% Semgrep parity achieved, supports pip, poetry, pipenv, uv.lock formats
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Parser**: 100% compatibility on npm, yarn, pnpm package files
- **Real-World Validation**: Tested on actual open-source projects including React, Vue.js, Django, Flask
- **Parser Framework**: Systematic validation using test suites from pip-tools, npm/semver, and yarn

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Fast vulnerability scanning in pipelines
2. **Large Monorepos**: Efficient scanning of hundreds of packages
3. **Cost-Sensitive Environments**: Dramatic reduction in API costs
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Quick security assessments during development
5. **Bulk Auditing**: Enterprise-wide dependency analysis

## 🔬 Methodology: PDR-Driven Development

This project pioneered a unique AI-first development approach using Product Design Requirements (PDR) combined with AI agent implementation directives.

### Key Files
- **`AI-Scanner-Specification.md`**: Complete technical specifications and requirements
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: AI agent implementation framework for Claude Code
- **`build.prompt`**: Universal engineering directives for any AI coding agent

### Why This Matters
The PDR + AI agent methodology enables:
- Consistent, high-quality implementations
- Clear separation between "what to build" (PDR) and "how to build" (AI directives)
- Reproducible development across different AI coding assistants
- Comprehensive documentation that serves both humans and AI agents

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=sca_ai_scanner

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
```
